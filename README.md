# Flags of the Beast World

[The Delvers Guide to Beast World](https://thedelversguide.com/) is a rulebook and a setting for the Dungeons & Dragons TTRPG. One of my weird hobbies is vexillology — I'm interested in flags. Some entities in Beast World would have flags and coats of arms. I asked about them in the #ask-the-devs channel, but the only reply I received said that they would be included in a future book.

In the meantime, I have designed some flags and will upload them to this thread.

I've tried to honour the traditional rules for creating flags in this world. I use traditional heraldic colours and simple designs. The rules make sense for a "medieval-style" society. For a brief introduction to flag design best practices, see [Good Flag, Bad Flag](https://nava.org/good-flag-bad-flag) by the North American Vexillological Association.
